[UPDATED] The /usr/local/apache/conf/modsec2.conf that is installed when modsec is
enabled via EasyApache is now ~1192 bytes in size. Previously it was smaller, and
if it was over 800 bytes, a warning would be printed that the file may contain customizations.
Now we print that warning if the file is over 1200 bytes in size.


[UPDATED] Added '/usr/local/cpanel/Cpanel/ThirdParty/Attracta/Hooks/pkgacct-restore'
to the list of hooks to be ignored in /var/cpanel/hooks.yaml .
