[NEW] Added a check for case 54844, where /scripts/ipcheck sends inaccurate emails that
state "IMPORTANT: Do not ignore this email. The hostname (foo) resolves to x.x.x.x. It
should resolve to x.x.x.x".


[NEW] Print a warning if the server's clock is skewed AND the server is running Dovecot,
stating how that can cause Dovecot to die each day.


[UPDATED] Added a tip about the Dovecot time skew issue. We get so many tickets on this
that it's worth having in SSP twice.
