[FIXED] Removed the check to see if cPanel is >= 11.29, and an update is available,
and updates are configured to run daily, and the server has not been updated in
more than 24 hours. The check was removed due to false positives. A check still
exists for cPanel <11.28 + daily updates enabled (which could indicate the server
is unable to update, requiring L3 investigation).
